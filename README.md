## Description
This is a webpage I created to test floats. It has three columns for different types of pictures and a main heading. 
## Setup
* Fork Code
* Open in editor of choice
* Code and customise away
## Known Bugs
The columns are not perfectly centered and leave a bit of empty space to the right. They also have not been properly scaled so they will look messy when you resize the window. 
## Technologies Used
* VSCode
* HTML
* CSS
